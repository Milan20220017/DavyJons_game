# DavyJons_game
This project was developed developed as part of a mini project organized by the student organization FONIS.
Our team of four created a 3D adventure game called Davy Jons, built using Unity and C#.
The goal of the game is to guide the main character through a series of levels inspired by pirate legends and mysterious underwater worlds. Players explore the environment, collect treasures, and face various challenges along the way.
This project allowed us to apply and expand our knowledge of game design, object-oriented programming, and Unity game engine development.
